# Advent of Code

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! ðŸŽ„ This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, a yearly programming event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new puzzle is released, testing problem-solving skills and programming proficiency.

### About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge event designed by Eric Wastl. Each day, participants solve two parts of a puzzle, typically involving algorithmic thinking, data manipulation, and sometimes a bit of creativity. Itâ€™s a great way to practice and improve programming skills while having fun.
